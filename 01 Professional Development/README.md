## Share Ideas
To get a good grade in this module you need to collaborate with other teams. The steps below will help you start this process.

1. Complete the Group Details Form on Moodle, describing both your team and your idea.
2. Identify any teams on Moodle that you might collaborate with and explain how this could take place.
3. Add these team members to your LinkedIn network.

## Getting Support
During this module you will be expected to work in a team to develop a sophisticated app using the language and platform of your choice, however this is not a technical module and you will not be taught the technical programming skills you need to apply.
If you are worried about your technical competence then it is recommended that you build a dynamic website. This can be achieved using the Python Flask framework. 

1. You will have been taught Python during your previous modules and the Flask framework is simple enough to pick up after a couple of hours. There are plenty of online tutorials that teach this topic.
2. The module covers a number of technical topics but there will always be sample code that can be applied to this language and framework.
3. Take advantage of the programming support sessions which run daily in the EC building. All staff running this can help you with Python code.
