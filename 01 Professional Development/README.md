# Professional Development

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities in your two lab sessions. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. The supporting presentation can be found at https://goo.gl/1UBucY

## GitHub
You are required to maintain your code on the University GitHub repository at `https://github.coventry.ac.uk` where you will be added to the module organisation. For this to happen you will need to have logged in in order to generate your profile. The first task is to **log in using your University credentials** and notify your lab tutors if you can't do this.

Once you are logged in you must upload a head and shoulders photo of yourself into your GitHub profile so that everyone knows who you are.

## Teams
You will have already been assigned to a team by the module leader. You can see a list of your team members by clicking on the **Participants** link on the Moodle module page. Since all the worksheet tasks need to be completed as a team you will need to email everyone and agree which two lab sessions you will be attending. Do this as soon as possible after the first lecture.

## Project
Read through the assignment brief and decide which project you will be working on, this choice will impact the work you carry out during this and subsequent weeks. Make sure you choose a **real client**, for some of the projects this is a named person but for the other projects you will need to choose someone (not one of the module staff though).

## Skills Audit
Perform a detailed analysis of the problem you are going to solve and perform a Skills Audit on your team. There are a list of generic skills listed in the presentation which you will need to supplement with skills related to your choice of project.

1. Identify any existing skills that will help you complete the project.
2. From this, identify any skills which your team is missing.
3. Rate each member of your team against each of these skills using a 5 point scale.
4. Repeat the exercise using the Four Stages of Competence.
5. Finally map these skills using the SfiA framework.
  1. You can download a range of guides from their website at http://www.sfia-online.org/en/get-sfia (you will need to register for a free account and log in).
  2. Use the Summary Chart to identify the skills you are competent in and use the full documentation to identify your level.
  3. Use the SFIA Reference Guide to understand what is required to achieve each level of each skill

## LinkedIn
Use this information gained in the previous section to update your LinkedIn Profile. Having one of these will improve your chances of getting a good graduate job.

1. Add a suitable professional profile picture
2. Update the education section.
3. Add any skills that you have mastered to SfIA level 4 or above.
4. Download your CV as a PDF.
5. Use the search bar at the top of the screen to locate your other team members and add them to your profile.
6. Repeat for other people in the group.
7. Can you find any of your lecturers? Invite some of them to your network.
8. Install LinkedIn on your smartphone...

## SWOT Analysis
Your next task is to carry out a SWOT analysis on your team and their proposed project.

## Team Building
By this stage you will have had an opportunity to observe your group dynamics.

1. Assess the contribution made by each member of the team using the information from the presentation.
2. Using the Group Roles listed in the presentation identify which categories each member of your team belong to. Do you have a balanced team?

## Team Collaboration
You should now have a clear idea about what you will be developing and there is a strong possibility that other teams will have chosen the same project. Sit down with other teams and use your skills audit and other information to decide whether you will collaborate on the development. You can choose to work with other teams or to complete the development using only your own team.

## Getting Support
During this module you will be expected to work in a team to develop a sophisticated app using the language and platform of your choice, however this is not a technical module and you will not be taught the technical programming skills you need to apply.
If you are worried about your technical competence then it is recommended that you build a dynamic website. This can be achieved using the Python Flask framework. 

1. You will have been taught Python during your previous modules and the Flask framework is simple enough to pick up after a couple of hours. There are plenty of online tutorials that teach this topic.
2. The module covers a number of technical topics but there will always be sample code that can be applied to this language and framework.
3. Take advantage of the programming support sessions which run daily in the EC building. All staff running this can help you with Python code.
