# Agile Development

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done.

This week is very important. You will be conducting your first sprint. To do this you will be expected to meet every morning to conduct your daily standup meeting (see below on how to do this) and will be expected to spend the rest of the day in your teams completing the work agreed.

You have already decided on who will be the **Scrum master** and the **product owner** and will already have prepared the **Kanban board** and **Burndown chart** which means you can dive straight into the coding.

You should refer to [this week's presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nAEwEr7C6VTcRLSTnGqzhDvFzvek8fcKZuNHcjikBBs) as well as [this short video from IBM](https://youtu.be/oHcmLKroPqw).

## 1 Conducting the Sprint

During this first sprint, your development team will need to carry out a **Daily Standup meeting** every morning. Before this meeting, the _Scrum Master_ should:

1. Check the _Kanban board_ is up to date.
2. add up the hours for all the tasks remaining incomplete on the Kanban board and using this to update the _Burndown Chart_.

```

From this Kanban board you can see that one of the tasks has been
completed (and so these hours come off the burndown chart).
One of the tasks has been started but is not yet complete (this stays
on the burndown chart)
The last task has not been fully planned out, this task should be a
priority until the next daily standup.

     ╚══════════════════════════    Can they make up the work by the Friday?
       M    T     W     T     F
```

During the meeting:

1. The Scrum Master reviews the burndown chart and tells the team whether they are ahead or behind schedule:
2. Now each member:
    1. explains what they have achieved since the last daily standup meeting.
    2. uses the Kanban board to identify the tasks they will work on until the next meeting (tomorrow), flags with the team responsible and moves these forward on the board.
    3. Describes any technical challenges that are holding back development work.

If any problems were identified during the standup these will need to be resolved by the appropriate team immediately **after** the daily standup. Make sure the resolution is explained to the _Scrum Master_ before continuing work.

Now each team have tasks assigned and will need to implement these before the next daily standup.

## 2 Getting Feedback

As part of the learning process you will need to conduct one of your sprints in a lab session so that your lab supervisors can watch and provide you with feedback that you can use to improve. You should attend the lab session that **starts at 09:00**.
