# Agile Development

Welcome to the final year **Agile Development** module. This will teach you the skills you need to work in a modern software development team. Along the way you will gain lots of experience in developing a software solution.

This repository contains all the worksheets and teaching materials.

## New Topics for 2017-18

### Benefits of web services

- Platform independent 
- Language independent
- Standard based – e.g. HTTP, XML, JSON, URI standards
- Application components
- Communicate using open protocols
- Self-contained and self-describing
- Can be discovered
- Can be used by other applications

### Principles of RESTful web services

Use HTTP methods explicitly 
-	(GET for retrieving, POST for creating a resource, DELETE, PUT)

Stateless
-	each request from client to server must contain all the information necessary to execute the request

Expose directory structure-like URIs
-	the structure of a URI should be straightforward, predictable, and easily understood.


Transfer XML, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or both.
-	This allows the service to be used by a variety of clients written in different languages running on different platforms and devices

### Features of revision control

Each change is usually identified by a revision number
Each revision has a timestamp and the person responsible
Revisions can be compared, restored, and merged

### Principles of agile supporting change

The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Changing requirements are welcome, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

Working software is delivered frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

### Principles of Lean Startups

1. Innovation Accounting
2. Entrepreneurs are Everywhere
3. Entrepreneurship is Management
4. Validated Learning
5. Build Learn Measure


### Innovation Accounting

Innovation accounting refers to the rigorous process of defining, empirically measuring and communicating the true progress of innovation 

### Lean Startup Methodology

1. Lean Startup helps manage uncertainty using the Lean startup methodology. The methodology will help determine whether her product is viable hence helping her work smarter.
2. Pivot means to change directions to test a new fundamental hypothesis about product but stay grounded in what we have learned.
3. Should start pivoting once they believes that their current approaching is not working. This can be validated by measuring their progress and whether it is moving the drivers of her business model. If it is not, it is time to pivot.

### Dynamic System Development Method

1) Active user involvement is imperative.
2) Teams must be empowered to make decisions. The four key variables of empowerment are: authority, resources, information and accountability.
3) Frequent delivery of products is essential.
4) Fitness for business purpose is the essential criterion for acceptance of deliverables.
5) Iterative and incremental development is necessary to converge on an accurate business solution.
6) All changes during development are reversible, i.e. you do not proceed further down a particular path if problems are encountered, you backtrack to the last safe or agreed point, and then start down a new path.
7) Requirements are baselined at a high level, i.e. the high-level business requirements, once agreed, are frozen. This is essentially the scope of the project.
8) Testing is integrated throughout the life cycle, i.e. ‘test as you go’ rather than testing just at the end where it frequently gets squeezed.

### Soft vs Hard Thinking

| Soft Systems Thinking | Hard Systems Thinking |
| --- | --- |
| organisational problems are ‘messy’ (Ackoff, 1974), poorly defined | objective reality of systems in the world |
| stakeholders interpret problems differently (no objective reality) | well-defined problem to be solved |
| human factors important | technical factors foremost |
| creative, intuitive approach to problem-solving | scientific approach to problem-solving |
| outcomes are learning, better understanding, rather than a ‘solution’ | one correct solution|
