# Agile Development

Welcome to the final year **Agile Development** module. This will teach you the skills you need to work in a modern software development team. Along the way you will gain lots of experience in developing a software solution.

## Learning Outcomes

On completion of this module the student should be able to:

1. Demonstrate a sound understanding of how Agile Methodologies can be used to define users’ requirements, analysis and design of information systems.
2. Compare and contrast a range of current and emerging agile methodologies
3. Evaluate the methods, techniques and tools for rapid development of various types of information systems, and the reasons for their selection and use.
4. Use a range of appropriate tools to contribute to the development of a solution to a real-world problem.

## Teaching Materials

The teaching materials are broken into 10 labs with each labsheet containing a link to the appropriate presentation. The labs follow a 2-week cycle:

1. the first week requires you to do preparations and think about your work.
2. in the second week you will be required to work as a professional development team.

## Assessment

The assignment brief can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nVFiPvzr2JUlvnpQTUqGl7gcrk3CzTI_euat3zIUFDk/edit?usp=sharing).

The grading rubric is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AO4dH6ZYQdrIcbOK5APYjq0SOeiysu1diDILMEcU__c/edit?usp=sharing).

## Module Overview

During this module you will be working in medium-sized multi-skilled development teams on a real problem. The content of the module is as follows:

1. Professional development
2. Agile planning (planning your agile project)
3. Architecture
4. Agile development (and your first sprint)
5. Automated code testing
6. Test-driven development (and the second sprint)
7. Advanced version control
8. Continuous integration (and the third sprint)
9. Acceptance testing
10. Continuous delivery (and the final sprint)
11. Exam revision

## The Team

You should already have access to the [Moodle Site](https://cumoodle.coventry.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=48328) for this module. On it you will see that you have been assigned to a team of between 8 and 9 students. The teams contain a balance of skills that will enable you to complete the project. You should take a moment to identify the other members of your team and get in contact with them.

## The Problem

You have been approached by an environmental monitoring company to develop a new range of smart sensors. These should capture data and send it over a wifi network to a central server. They also want a smartphone app that their customers can use to monitor the system. You will be finding out more during the week 2 labs.

## The Sensor Technology

As part of the project outcomes you will be expected to build prototype remote sensors using off-the-shelf components. Whilst you can use anything you can source, here are a few options you might consider, given the requirements for the sensor to communicate over a WiFI network:

1. [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) - Either a model 3 with built-in wifi (and bluetooth) or an earier version with additional dongles.
2. [NodeMCU](http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html) - a low cost (£3) development board compatible with Arduino IDEs and can be programmed in C++, Python or Lua.
3. [Arduino Uno Wifi](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-wifi): A standard Arduino board with integrated Wifi.

If you plan on working on the sensor module you should get hold of some suitable hardware and learn to use it before the start of the module.
