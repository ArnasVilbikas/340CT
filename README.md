# Agile Development

Welcome to the final year **Agile Development** module. This will teach you the skills you need to work in a modern software development team. Along the way you will gain lots of experience in developing a software solution.

This repository contains all the worksheets and teaching materials and you should begin by cloning it and accessing the materials through your preferred IDE. You should choose whatever IDE you prefer but the materials will focus on using the Cloud 9 online IDE which will give you access not only to a modern IDE but also provides a small Ubuntu server with a terminal and sudo access.
