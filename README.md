# New Structure

All development to be done using NodeJS (and Express/Handlebars).

Version control using GitLab.

Start with master read-only repository (forking workflow).

## 1 Software Systems

## 2 Version Control

1. Forking workflow
2. GitLab
3. Basic branching

## 3 Architecture

1. HTTP v MQTT
2. MVC

## 4 Software Quality Indicators and Metrics

## 5 Project Management

1. estimation

## 6 Automated Code Testing

## 7 Test-Driven Development

## 7 Automated Acceptance Testing

## 8 Advanced Version Control

1. GitFlow?
1. Rebasing

## 8 Continuous Integration and Delivery

----

# Assessment Rubric

1. Design model
2. Annotated source code
3. Test suite
4. Branching model
5. Process maturity
6. Evaluation of agile technique

# Notes

Start project with a hub and spoke architecture. Each student (team?) contributes a module to this. Perhaps use pubsub MQTT broker? Also can tap into building data?

# Sample Tasks

1. System log
