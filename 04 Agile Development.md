# Agile Development

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. The supporting presentation can be found at https://goo.gl/b2VsSw

## Sprint Planning

As a team:

1. Identify who will be the **Scrum Master** and who will be the **Product Owner**.
2. Ideally with the client present, take the first user story from the top row of your user story map:
    1. The product owner describes it from the user's perspective
    2. Discusses how it can be implemented and work collaboratively on a whiteboard/flipchart to define it's UI until the client/product owner is satisfied/
    3. Explain the success criteria (how will the team know they have completed the story implementation.
3. Once the client has left:
    1. Break the story into the component tasks and write these on sticky notes
    2. Use planning poker to estimate how many hours each task will take
    2. Add them to the left column of your Kanban board

## Conducting the Sprint

During this first sprint, your development team will need to meet every morning. At each meeting.

1. Review the burndown chart to see if the team are ahead or behind schedule
2. Now each member:
    1. explains what they have achieved since the last daily standup meeting.
    2. uses the Kanban board to identify the tasks they will work on until the next meeting (tomorrow), flags with the team responsible and moves these forward on the board.
    3. Describes any technical challenges that are holding back development work.

If any problems were identified during the standup these will need to be resolved by the appropriate team immediately after the daily standup. Make sure the resolution is explained to the _Scrum Master_ before continuing work.

Now each team have tasks assigned and will need to implement these before the next daily standup.

## Review Meeting

You will be given a date for the review meeting, this will typically be a week after the start of the sprint. During this meeting you will be expected to do a local demo of the software you built during the sprint so make sure you are prepared.

1. The **Product Owner** reads the user story/storys completed during the sprint.
2. The **Scrum Master** demonstrates the new features to the client.
3. Any bugs identified are added to the Kanban board to be addressed in the next sprint.

The team then move on to the next _sprint planning meeting_ whilst the client is present.

## Retrospective

Each week the development team should meet up (without the client) and ask each member of the team to identify:

1. What they should continue to do (existing good practice)
2. What they should **start** doing (new good practice)
2. What they should **stop** doing (eliminiate bad practices)
