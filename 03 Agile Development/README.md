# Agile Development

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. The supporting presentation can be found at https://goo.gl/D306mp

## Team Review
From this point onwards you will be working in a close-knit team. Since your experiences of agile development (and hence your ultimate understanding) will depend on this interaction you need to have agreed your final team makeup and project focus by the end of this week.

1. If you are not in a team make sure you attend every lab session and engage with others to find yourself a group.
2. If you are in a small team (2-3 members) make every effort to combine with other small teams.
3. Review team members' project commitment by discussing their attendance and punctuality and allow each team member to explain their position.
4. Review the choice of project the team will be developing and make sure:
  1. Each team member will be able to contribute to the technical development.
  2. The choice will allow you to collaborate with other teams.
  3. Update the Group List on Moodle by completing the Group Details Form again.

## Set Up Collaboration Tools
Communication is key during agile development. You should set up and use both paper-based and electronic tools which you can compare and contrast in your reflective report.

1. Create accounts and set up team workspaces in the most popular online collaboration platforms:
  1. Slack
  2. Trello
  3. GitLab (create an organisation and project).
  4. Toggl (integrates with Trello)
2. Install the smartphone apps to allow you to collaborate away from your computer.
3. Use the flipchart paper and post-it notes to create a Kanban board and add your user stories.

##Set Up Scrum
Make sure you are conversant with the principles of scrum:

1. Assign roles to the members of your team and make sure those assigned the roles fully understand their jobs. Each sprint you should rotate the roles so that everyone in your team has had a chance to try them all.
  1. Product owner
  2. Scrum master
  3. Development team
2. Build the product backlog which comprises all the user stories that might form part of the product.
  1. Write these out on sticky notes.
  2. Create these as Trello cards.
  3. In GitLab add each story as an issue, this will assign it an issue number.
3. Prioritise the product backlog:
  1. All team members should contribute
  2. Final decision is taken by the product owner who needs to justify their decision to the rest of the team.
  3. MoSCoW rules are applied to the backlog as a final check.


## Estimation
Return to your team of four and start estimating the size of the agreed set of user stories

1. Play planning poker with your user stories, assigning a difficulty score to each.
2. Arrange your stories in order of difficulty and make sure you are all in agreement.
3. Identify the stories which are easy to estimate duration.
4. Use this to estimate the duration of each job.
  1. Estimate the team velocity.
  2. Assuming a delivery date at the end of week 9, can the project be completed on schedule?
  3. Discuss this with the collaborating teams and identify strategies to ensure this happens.
5. Identify which stories make up the minimum viable product.

## Sprint Planning
Now that you have set up your scrum framework you will run through your first sprint planning session. Take care to follow and make sense of the process, you will be doing this every fortnight until the end of the module (4 iterations).

1. Take the top item from the prioritised product backlog and decide whether it can be achieved in the current sprint.
  1. If not, you may need to review your user stories to make them smaller.
2. Take the second item and decide whether this should be included in the sprint or whether it should be the stretch task.
3. The Product Owner should describe the functional requirements to the rest of the team who should ask questions to clarify their understanding.
4. The entire team now discuss how this feature could be implemented:
  1. Discuss how the solution will interact with the problem domain.
  2. Use a range of design patterns to describe how this could be implemented.
  3. Discuss the user interface and how the user could interact with it.
  4. Define 'done' and describe how it could be tested.
5. Split the work between pairs of developers.

## Starting the Sprint
Now you can start writing code:

1. Use pair programming principles to develop code to solve the user story in the current sprint.
2. Make sure you rotate the driver and navigator roles roughly every hour.
3. Hold a stand-up meeting regularly and update your burndown chart beforehand.
