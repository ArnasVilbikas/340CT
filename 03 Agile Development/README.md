# Agile Development

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. The supporting presentation can be found at https://goo.gl/ozFzjj

## Team Review

You have already put together a development team with between 6 and 10 developers and from this week onwards you will be using agile development methodologies to build a solution to a real-world problem. Before starting:

1. Review team members' project commitment by discussing their attendance and punctuality and allow each team member to explain their position.
2. Review the choice of project the team will be developing and make sure each team member will be able to contribute to the technical development.
3. Speak to your lab tutor and make sure the group list on Moodle is up to date with all the names of your team.

## Set Up Collaboration Tools
Communication is key during agile development. You should set up and use both paper-based and electronic tools which you can compare and contrast in your reflective report.

1. Create accounts and set up team workspaces in the most popular online collaboration platforms:
  1. Slack
  2. Trello
  3. GitLab (create an organisation and project).
  4. Toggl (integrates with Trello)
2. Install the smartphone apps to allow you to collaborate away from your computer.

## Set Up Scrum
Make sure you are conversant with the principles of scrum:

1. Assign roles to the members of your team and make sure those assigned the roles fully understand their jobs. Each sprint you should rotate the roles so that everyone in your team has had a chance to try them all.
  1. Product owner (the real client should assume this role if possible)
  2. Scrum master
  3. Development team
2. Build the product backlog which comprises all the user stories that might form part of the product.
  1. Write these out on sticky notes.
  2. Create these as Trello cards.
  3. In GitLab add each story as an issue, this will assign it an issue number.
3. Prioritise the product backlog:
  1. All team members should contribute
  2. Final decision is taken by the product owner who needs to justify their decision to the rest of the team.
  3. MoSCoW rules are applied to the backlog as a final check.


## Sprint Planning Meeting

This week you will conduct your first sprint so you will need to conduct your first sprint planning meeting:

1. Make sure everyone in the meeting can see the latest **agile roadmap** that was created last week.
2. The product owner should describe the highest priority feature to the team.
  1. As this is being described, the development team should ask as many questions as needed to fully understand it.
  2. The development team should define the **sprint goal**, a short one or two sentence description of what the team thinks they need to achieve.
  3. The product owner will use this to check the team really understand the requirements.
  4. Sketch out any interface elements needed to implement the current sprint and get sign-off from the _product owner_.
  5. Once the product owner is comfortable with the team's understanding they can leave the meeting. If one of your team is taking on the role of product owner they can now resume their role as a developer.
3. The development team now work on the **sprint backlog**.
  1. The work required to achieve the sprint goal is broken down and described in technical terms.
  2. The developers use an estimation technique such as **planning poker** to determine how long each part will take.
  3. The tasks are assigned to the pairs of developers in the development team who decide how much they will achieve by the end of the sprint.
  4. The tasks are added to the team's Kanban board.

## Starting the Sprint
The sprint will run for exactly one week. During this time the development team should briefly meet on a daily basis, this is the **daily standup** meeting. The format is:

1. Each pair of programmers demonstrate the current state of their code.
2. They describe what they have achieved since the last meeting, yesterday (this will have been recorded during the previous stand-up).
3. The tasks on the Kanban board are moved to reflect the progress made.
4. They explain any barriers they have encountered and these must be actioned by the Scrum Master before the next stand-up meeting.
5. Each pair of programmers now explain what they will have achieved before the next stand-up meeting tomorrow.
6. This is recorded.

Now each pair of programmers now settle down to produce the code they have agreed to:

1. Pair programming principles should be used to develop code to meet the target they have agreed.
2. The driver and navigator roles should be rotated regularly.
