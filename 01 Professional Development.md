# Professional Development

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities in your two lab sessions. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. You should refer to [this week's presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1maN7cEkJXG__t6YWewKS0CRNGLpGPmmDgYxusmk7LRA).

## GitHub
You are required to maintain your code on the [University GitHub repository](https://github.coventry.ac.uk) where you will be added to the module organisation. For this to happen you will need to have logged in in order to generate your profile. The first task is to **log in using your University credentials** and notify your lab tutors if you can't do this.

Once you are logged in you must upload a head and shoulders photo of yourself into your GitHub profile so that everyone knows who you are.

## Teams
You will have already been assigned to a team by the module leader. You can see a list of your team members by clicking on the relevent file in this repository. Since all the worksheet tasks need to be completed as a team you will need to email everyone to ensure you all meet up together for _every_ lab session.

## Project
Read through the assignment brief and decide which project you will be working on, this choice will impact the work you carry out during this and subsequent weeks. Make sure you choose a **real client**, for some of the projects this is a named person but for the other projects you will need to choose someone (not one of the module staff though).

## Skills Audit
Perform a detailed analysis of the problem you are going to solve and perform a Skills Audit on your team. There are a list of generic skills listed in the presentation which you will need to supplement with skills related to your choice of project.

### Skill List

Below is a list of skills your team will need in order to successfull build the product for your client:

1. Electronics
2. Programming microcontrollers
3. Building APIs
4. Building smartphone apps

In addition there are some _crossover_ skills that apply to multiple teams:

1. Version control using Git
2. Programming ability:
    1. Python
    2. NodeJS
    3. C++
3. Automated testing

Create a **Team Competency Matrix** using a simple **Red-Amber-Green** (RAG) scale as shown in the lecture. This should include all the skills listed above plus any others you feel might be useful.

Refine the matrix using a 5 point scale.

Working together develop a **Professional Development Plan** for each team member, identifying what they need to learn before the start of the development process in week 4. This will be reviewed in future weeks.

## Team Psychology

You have been introduced to a number of important (and potentially interesting?) areas of psychology that relate to group behaviour. As a group study each of these by finding additional information online and discuss how each may impact the cohesion of the team and its effectiveness at completing the product.

## LinkedIn
Use this information gained in the previous section to update your LinkedIn Profile. Having one of these will improve your chances of getting a good graduate job.

1. Add a suitable professional profile picture
2. Update the education section.
3. Add any skills that you have mastered to SfIA level 4 or above.
4. Download your CV as a PDF.
5. Use the search bar at the top of the screen to locate your other team members and add them to your profile.
6. Repeat for other people in the group.
7. Can you find any of your lecturers? Invite some of them to your network.
8. Install LinkedIn on your smartphone...

## Team Building
By this stage you will have had an opportunity to observe your group dynamics.

1. Assess the contribution made by each member of the team using the information from the presentation.
2. Using the Group Roles listed in the presentation identify which categories each member of your team belong to. Do you have a balanced team?

## Team Collaboration
You should now have a clear idea about what you will be developing and there is a strong possibility that other teams will have chosen the same project. Sit down with other teams and use your skills audit and other information to decide whether you will collaborate on the development. You can choose to work with other teams or to complete the development using only your own team.

## Getting Support
During this module you will be expected to work in a team to develop a sophisticated app using the language and platform of your choice, however this is not a technical module and you will not be taught the technical programming skills you need to apply.
