# Test-Driven Development

In this first lab you will be learning about an important technique called **Test-Driven Development** (TDD). The language you will be using is called NodeJS and is based on ECMA6, the latest incarnation of JavaScript. By the end of this lab you:

1. Should be familiar with the usage and syntax of JavaScript running both on the server and in the browser.
2. Should be familiar with the usage and syntax of the Jasmine unit testing framework.
3. Should be comfortable following the three-step TDD process.

If you have never programmed in JavaScript before it is recommended that you work through the [following set of exercises](https://github.coventry.ac.uk/205CDE-1819JANMAY/TEACHING-MATERIALS) to build your familiarity, focussing on the following topics:

1. Templating
2. Forms
3. Express Web Server
4. Dynamic Websites

Once you are familiar with the language and platform you can move onto the following key exercises that cover the TDD process.
