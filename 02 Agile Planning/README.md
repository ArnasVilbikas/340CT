# Agile Planning

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. The supporting presentation can be found at https://goo.gl/7YrDjD

## User Stories
Split into two pairs with one pair representing the customer and the other pair the development team.

1. Pair off with one developer talking to one customer and move out of hearing of the other pair.
2. The customer should write out their user stories on the paper provided.
3. The developer should support the process remembering to apply the INVEST principles.
4. Compare the user stories between the pairs. Are there any common stories?
5. Discuss the user stories and assemble the important ones, reject the others but give reasons for each rejection.
6. Discuss your team's user stories with other teams
  1. merge any similar stories
  2. agree a set of user stories (the Master Story List)
  3. neatly copy these user stories onto file cards.
7. Arrange the user stories into a suitable sequence and group the stories into releases.
  1. define the minimum viable product.
  2. pare this down to the absolute minimum feature set to provide value.

## Estimation
Return to your team of four and start estimating the size of the agreed set of user stories

1. Play planning poker with your user stories, assigning a difficulty score to each.
2. Arrange your stories in order of difficulty and make sure you are all in agreement.
3. Identify the stories which are easy to estimate duration.
4. Use this to estimate the duration of each job.
  1. Estimate the team velocity.
  2. Assuming a delivery date at the end of week 9, can the project be completed on schedule?
  3. Discuss this with the collaborating teams and identify strategies to ensure this happens.
5. Identify which stories make up the minimum viable product.

## Technical Planning
You will start development next week so take time to start planning.

1. Identify the development platform
  1. What will be your primary development language?
  2. What frameworks will your team be using?
  3. Make sure you are comfortable with the mechanics of writing automated tests for your chosen language including testing async code and creating mocks:
    1. [UnitTest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for Python
    2. [JUnit](http://junit.org) for Java
    3. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) for JavaScript
    4. Microsoft [Unit Test Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh598960.aspx) for .NET
    5. XCUnit for Swift
2. Starting with the stories that form the minimum viable product:
  1. Design the interface
  2. Identify any proof-of-concepts needed
