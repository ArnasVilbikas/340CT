# Distributed Version Control

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. The supporting presentation can be found at https://goo.gl/3udHd9.

The reflection section at the end of this worksheet will get you thinking about your work and provide useful information to put in your individual report.

if you are still unfamiliar with basic git principles:

1. Complete the tutorial on Codeacademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
2. Read through the **Version Control Fundamentals** presentation (https://goo.gl/dpD1gG)

## Sprint Review

By this stage you have completed your first sprint and so you will need to hold a sprint review meeting. Make sure you have invited your client.

1. The team demonstrate the product, showing that the first user story(s) have been completed and that the product is useful to the client.
2. The client gives feedback and may be in a position to sign off the work carried out so far.
3. The client and developers use the Kanban board to identify any issues in the sprint backlog that were not completed.
4. The client and developers update the _User Story Map_:
  1. Change the story priority based on the client's current requirements.
  2. Decide what will be included in the next sprint.
5. The Kanban board is updated with:
  1. Any issues resulting from the first sprint.
  2. The user stories from the new sprint.

## Configuring GitHub
By now you should have started to implement your first user story so you will already have some code under development. In this first task you will be putting this code under version control to help track changes and manage issues.

1. Make sure all of your team members have access to the University GitHub server at https://github.coventry.ac.uk and have added their full name and photo to their user profile. If any of your team can't log in they will need to request access by visiting the IT Help Desk in the Library.
2. One of your team should create a private group and invite all the members of your team.
3. Create as many _private_ repositories as you need and add the team to it.
4. Try creating a _main_ project repository and adding the other repositories as _submodules_.

## Branching Strategy

During this sprint you will continue to apply the agile skills you have already learned (such as scrum) but will also be applying the Git Flow branching workflow we covered in the lecture.

## Second Sprint

Now you have a sprint backlog you will need to spend the week completing this. Daily standups have an important role in making sure your team are working effectively, don't skip these.

## Reflection

Now you have mastered the basics, explore some alternative working practices and compare their effectiveness. During the week:

1. Get the scrum master to book a group space such as in the Library or the Hub. Spend a whole day working in this space.
2. Spend a day with each member of the team working from home.

Now compare the efficiency of these working practices.
