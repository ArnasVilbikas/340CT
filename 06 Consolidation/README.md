# Consolidation Week

The pace of development in this module has been fast so this week there will be no new technical knowledge or skills to learn and you will be given the opportunity to consolidate your learning. You can access the slides here https://goo.gl/XdLHA4.

## Goals

By next week's lecture you will be starting a new sprint so you need to have:

1. Completed your **business domain model**.
2. Brought your **user story map** up to date.
3. Consolidated your **Kanban board**.
4. Implemented a suitable _git branching strategy_.
5. Written all your completed _user stories_ in a suitable _DSL_ together with enough _scenarios_ to demonstrate compliance.
6. Written a suite of acceptance tests (preferably as _Cumcumber Step Definitions_).

Make a thorough job of completing these tasks and avoid the temptation to squeeze in another sprint!

## Reflective Report

Now is a good time to think about starting your _reflective report_. This is worth 50% of your module grade and demonstrates your understanding of the concepts covered in this module.
